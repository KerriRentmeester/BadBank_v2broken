# **Project Name**:  

Bad Bank

# **Description**: 

The Bad Bank project was deployed via Amazon Web Service S3 bucket and can be accessed here to see its capabilities: 

The Bad Bank project, a React app, is "bad" because there is no security. As a front end banking app, however; it has a register and login page, as well as a deposit and withdraw page. Additionally, there is a home page and a page that tracks all the data in one session. The account balance, initialized at zero, is displayed on the deposit page and the account balance, initialized at $100, is displayed on the withdraw page. Unfortunately the account balance is not linked across pages.

The following validation was employed:
*

The Bad Bank project is an example of the following skills and capabilities: routing, context, tracking state, event handling, parent/child relationships, and forms. I employed Bootstrap and CSS for styling, as well as HTML5, JavaScript, and JSX. As such, this project is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of a similar activity I worked on in September of 2023 from Module 19 and Portfolio II in the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

I changed the original course task in the following ways:
*varied the card color for register, login, deposit, and withdraw pages to further differentiate among the banking tasks.

# **Installation & Dependencies**: 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Bootstrap, Babel.

To use the app, follow these steps:
*Clone the repository or download the code files.
*Navigate to the project directory in your editor (ex/VSCode).

The following commands need to be entered in the terminal, after navigating to the project directory:
*npm install
*npm install bootstrap
*npm install react-router-dom
*npm start

# **Usage / How to Run**:

The app initiates on the home page, which is fairly generic, giving instructions to use the nav bar to perform desired tasks. The first step would be to "Create Account" or "Login." Once logged in, the user can "Deposit" or "Withdraw" and see the account "Balance" on either of those pages. On the third page, one can see "AllData."

# **Support**: 

Please contact me via email at krentmeester@uwalumni.com.

# **Roadmap**: 

Future fixes or improvements that would be helpful to a user:

*I am in the middle of devloping the app. Updates forthcoming.

# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
